class RiskManager:
    """
    Handles pre-trade risk assessments for trading operations.

    This class is intended to centralize risk management logic, such as
    checking for duplicate positions, assessing order size against capital,
    and other user-defined rules before an order is placed.

    Note: This class provides a foundational structure. The validation logic
          is currently implemented directly within the KISApiClient's
          `place_order` method. Future work could involve refactoring that
          logic into this RiskManager.
